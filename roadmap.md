# Cyber Security Roadmap (Beginner → Intermediate)

## Overview (short)
A practical learning path:
1. Foundations: Networking, Operating Systems
2. Programming: Python (recommended), JavaScript (for web)
3. Choose a path: Red Team (offense) or Blue Team (defense)
4. Practical training: CTFs, labs, tools
5. Portfolio: GitHub projects, writeups, CTF results

---

## 1. Foundations
- **Networking**: Learn TCP/IP, OSI model, DNS, routing, common ports and protocols.
- **Linux & Windows basics**: shell, file system, users, permissions, basic commands.
- **Core security concepts**: CIA triad, authentication, authorization, hashing, encryption basics.

## 2. Programming Basics
- **Python**: scripting, reading/writing files, web requests, subprocess, basic sockets.
- **JavaScript**: DOM, basic web app behavior, client-side input handling (useful for web hacking).

## 3. Choose Your Path
- **Red Team (Offensive)**:
  - Topics: Web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi), binary exploitation, priv-esc, exploit development.
  - Tools: Burp Suite, Nmap, Metasploit, GDB.
  - Practice: TryHackMe, HackTheBox, CTFs (pwn, web, crypto, misc).

- **Blue Team (Defensive)**:
  - Topics: Incident response, digital forensics, monitoring, logging, SIEM (Splunk/ELK), threat hunting.
  - Tools: Wireshark, Splunk (or OSS alternatives), Zeek, OSQuery.
  - Practice: Build labs, practice log analysis, participate in defensive CTFs.

## 4. Practical Training
- Start with guided rooms (TryHackMe beginner paths).
- Read writeups and reproduce solutions.
- Join community CTFs; document every challenge you solve.

## 5. Build Your Portfolio
- Publish scripts/tools on GitHub.
- Write clear README and usage examples.
- Post CTF writeups and blog posts (or GitHub pages).
